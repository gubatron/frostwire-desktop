	of the logging event. The detailed view displays, in addition,
	the date, message number, location (i.e. the method that is
	logging the message), thread description and the
	throwable. The view selector on the toolbar switches between
	the three views. Columns in the Log Table can be re-sized and

	(no checkmark is shown next to it) then new messages on that
	logger will not be displayed. The Logger Explorer has no
	effect on log messages already in the Log Table.
      </p>
                                                <p>The Logger Explorer displays loggers in a hierarchical
	tree-like fashion.  Loggers are identified with
	dot-separated names similar to Java package and class
	names. The name components are mapped to the levels in the
	hierarchy in the Logger Explorer. For example, the logger
	name org.apache.applications.log4j.InitUsing Log4JProperties
	is displayed below: 
      </p>

                                                <p>When a logger in a hierarchy is deselected, no messages at
	that level or below will appear in the Log Table. For example,
	if just the first InitUsingMultipleAppenders logger in the
	examples.InitUsingMultipleAppenders.InitUsingMultipleAppenders
	logger is deselected, then messages with the logger examples
	would be displayed in the Log Table, but messages with the
	logger InitUsingMultipleAppenders.InitUsingMultipleAppenders
	would be filtered and not displayed in the Log Table.

                                                <p>Log4j provides a lightweight technique for stamping log
	requests initiated from the same client within a multithreaded
	system. The Nested Diagnostic Context (NDC) provides an easy
	way to differentiate logging output of one client from
	another. The NDC is also useful for differentiating log
	messages being output by different members of a large
	development team building an application on the same
	server. To improve the sorting of potentially thousands of log
	records being output from multiple clients, a NDC filter has
	been provided. To use the NDC filter, select the Edit menu
	item and choose 'Sort by NDC'. Fill in the name of the NDC you
	would like to filter on. All records containing the filter key
	word will be displayed in the Log Table. To restore all of the
	log records use the Edit -&gt; Restore all NDC's. You can also
	use the Edit-&gt;Find feature to locate NDC's without removing
	log records from the Log Table. Furthermore, you can use the
	Configure-&gt;Save feature to persist the last NDC filter key
	word that was used. Note however that restoring all NDCs will
	effectively erase the NDC filter key word. Refer to the <a href="#configuration">Configuration section</a> below for more
	information on saving NDC filter key words.</p>

                                                <p>LogFactor5 supports reading in log files that were created
	using log4j's RollingFileAppender.  The benefit of this
	feature is that developers who run utilities like Ant to test
	their applications can now view their log files off-line
	(i.e. after their application has completed the test and the
	JVM has shut down). Reading log files currently only works for
	files written a LogFactor5's unique ConversionPattern.  For
	more information on setting the LogFactor5 conversion pattern,
	please see the OpeningLogFiles example. To open a file and
	read it into LogFactor5, you need to start the logging console
	using the StartLogFactor5Console.bat file provided in the bin
	directory. Once the console is open, choose File-&gt;Open from
	the menu at the top of the GUI.

                                                <p>LogFactor5 supports reading log files created using log4j
	from a URL. Having the ability to open log files on a remote
	server provides the ability for multiple developers working on
	the same application to view log files independently.  It also
	gives developers the ability to view log files both internally
	and from remote locations. Reading log files currently only
	works for files written a LogFactor5's unique
	ConversionPattern. For more information on setting the
	LogFactor5 conversion pattern, please see the <a href="example7.html">OpeningLogFiles</a> example. To open a
	file and read it into LogFactor5, you need to start the
	logging console using the StartLogFactor5Console.bat file
	provided in the bin directory.  Once the console is open,

	configuration. When you choose the Configuration-&gt;Save
	option from the menu at the top of the GUI, the loggers and
	levels that you currently have selected, along with the last
	NDC filter key word used (assuming 'Restore all NDC's' has not
	been selected), are saved to your local file system. This
	means that the next time you start up the console you will not
	need to reselect the loggers, levels, and NDC filter that you
	would like used for filtering.
      </p>
                                                <p>LogFactor5 also allows you to remove your saved
	configuration, and to configure the maximum number of records
	that will be displayed at any time in the logging
	console. Setting the maximum number of records to display
	allows you to optimize LogFactor5's performance for your
	system. The maximum number of records can also be configured
	via a log4j properties file.
